# SharpFNT

## Introduction
SharpFNT is a C# library for reading and writing [Angel Code bitmap fonts](http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/) in binary, XML and text. It can be downloaded on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharpFNT/). It was written for my upcoming game called [Everchanging](http://www.beacongames.com). 

## Possible Future Additions
1. A class for creating the character rectangles for rendering and measuring.
1. Support for earlier versions of the format.
1. Additional target frameworks.
