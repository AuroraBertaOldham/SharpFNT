# SharpFNT

## Introduction
SharpFNT is a C# library for reading and writing [Angel Code bitmap fonts](http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/). The binary, XML, and text formats are all supported. This is still a work in progress and is not ready for use. This will be available on Nuget later.

## Possible Future Additions
1. An optional library for creating the character rectangles for rendering and measuring.
1. Support for earlier versions of the format.
1. Additional target frameworks.
